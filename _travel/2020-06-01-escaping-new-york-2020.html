<section class="text">
    <p>When the pandemic first hit in March 2020, like many others, I thought that I would be weathering the lockdown for just a few days or a week or two in New York would be easy. But as days turned into weeks and weeks to months, leaving the city became a necessity.</p>
    <p>Over the next two years, I would escape to many a pandemic hideaway, most close to New York and others farther. By the end of 2021, I had made my way to New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico.</p>
    <p>I was very lucky to never catch COVID and be able to work remotely, first at The Times and later with Ambrook, making it possible to endure lockdown in more spacious accommodations than my New York City apartment. My first stop was New Hampshire.</p>

    <h2>North Conway, NH</h2>
    <p>In April of 2020, hastily packed suitcases and boxes in tow, my roommate Nathan and I fled to his family's house in North Conway, New Hampshire. We didn't know then how long we'd be there (months) and that we'd return several times over the next two years. This house, nestled into the White Mountains, was a welcome change of pace from the city.</p>
