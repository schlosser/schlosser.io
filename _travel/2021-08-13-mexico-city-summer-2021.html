  <p>There was a magic time, in the summer of 2021, where it felt like Covid was really getting under control. People were getting vaccinated and all the bad numbers were dropping. International travel was beginning to open up and my wanderlust was peaking. I had learned my lesson from <a href="/travel/alaska-summer-2021/">Alaska</a>, though. While working at a startup, being unplugged for an extended trip was tricky. There was a lot to do!</p>
  <p>With all of this in mind, my friend Diane and I came up with the plan to spend a week working from Mexico City. We could both work remotely (Diane at Google and me at Ambrook), so it fit perfectly. Mexico City checked all the boxes: great food and rich cultural history in a big enough city to have good Wi-Fi and in a US-friendly timezone. And, with New York experiencing peak-gross-heat, August was a perfect time to escape. We booked our flights and a fantastic Airbnb (a 2-bedroom penthouse with a roof deck for less than $75/night per person) and set off!</p>

  <p>We were working during the week, so most of our exploration of Mexico City took place on bookended weekends. I was excited to see Mexico City architecture for myself, exploring various neighborhoods and parks.</p>

  <p>In the center of the city is Chapultepec park, the second-largest park in Latin America. At its center is Chapultepec Castle, which sits on top of a hill, and is accessible only by a spiraling ramp.</p>

  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>One of the biggest draws to visit Mexico City was the food. We enjoyed all sorts of meals in our week, from street tacos to upscale tasting menus. With respect to fine dining, we got extremely lucky, with last minute reservations opening up at Pujol, Quintonil, Sud 777, and Lorea.</p>

  <h2>Teotihuacán</h2>
  <p>After some time exploring the city, we also made the trip to Teotihuacán, about an hour outside of Mexico City. The site is an archeological site of an ancient Mesoamerican city. With dozens of partial structures, staircases, and two massive stepped pyramids, Teotihuacán was by far the most impressive site like this I've seen in the world.</p>
