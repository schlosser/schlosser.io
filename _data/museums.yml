    I quickly fell in love with MONA for its architecture. Built mostly
    underground into the side of a hill, the building is at once unremarkable
    from the outside and stunning on the inside. Even more impressive was the
    exhibition and curation. My favorite pieces were several by James Turell,
    an American MacArthur Genius Grant-winning artist that works mostly with
    light and space.

    I mean, it's the freaking Louvre. I have spent entire days wandering the
    halls of the Louvre and still left feeling like I had only seen a fraction
    of the museum. While there are many other reasons to travel to Paris, the
    Louvre alone is reason enough. I especially love the west wing, where five
    massive rooms are filled entirely with sculpture.

    The D. T. Suzuki museum is more experience than museum. While there is a
    small exhibition space that offers a historical look into this Japanese Zen
    philosopher, what pulls me back to Kanazawa to return here is the large
    outdoor contemplative space. Several times larger than the exhibition space
    indoors, this outdoor pool and walking area is intended for contemplation
    of Suzuki's writing and work.

    While a bit out of the way for visitors to Copenhagen, the Louisiana Museum
    is a must-visit. Architects Jørgen Bo and Wilhlem Wohlert transformed a
    suburban villa into a circular exhibition route that meanders between
    galleries and nature, above and below ground, from the forest to a lake, and
    to the sea. In my visit, I thoroughly enjoyed the permanent collection in
    the sculpture garden, and the rotation of modern and contemporary art in the
    three galleries. I speant nearly a full day at the Louisiana and I'd
    recommend anyone visiting Copenhagen to do the same.

    I've been to the Mori Art Museum twice, and was seriously impressed both
    times. The first was an exhibit on Japanese architecture, and the second
    was an exhibition called "The Soul Trembles" which very much lived up to
    its name. Located at the top of Mori Tower in Roppongi, the musueum has no
    permanent collection, just several gallery spaces. While I can't predict
    what will be on display in the future, I very much like the curators' taste.

    New York City has no shortage of fantastic museums to explore within its

    of Dia:Beacon, an art museum on the banks of the Hudson River that houses a
    massive permanent collection of massive artworks, as well as a few special
    exhibitions. The museum occupies a Former Nabisco box-printing factory,
    which means awesome high ceilings, beautiful lighting, and even a creepy

    Roman, and Greek sculpture may not rival that of the Louvre, but the
    presentation of the sculpture might. Located in downtown Copenhagen,
    Glytotek is easily accessible and a must-visit for travelers to Denmark.

    The only museum in my mind that can try to rival the Louvre is the Met.
    Having spent time living in the Upper East and Upper West Sides of New York
    City, getting to casually pop into the Met on an afternoon or evening is a
    privilege. Newcomers will flock to the Greek and Roman collection or to
    the preserved and recreated Egyptian tomb, but even after several visits
    I'm still finding new corners of the American Wing or enjoying temporary
    exhibitions.

    While the D. T. Suzuki Museum wins "best in Kanazawa, Japan" for me, I
    remain quite impressed with the collection of contemporary art in the 21st

    how it was created. While that exhibit did not allow photography, this
    underwater pool exhibit did. See how they did it?

    The New York MoMA was the first modern art museum I visited as a conscious
    adult. While I firmly believe the MoMA is a must-visit for tourists and
    first-timers, I've been occasionally less lucky with some temporary
    exhibitions, but most of the time MoMA nails it. With exhibitions like
    their Charles White retrospective and the curious handcrafted cityscapes of
    Bodys Isek Kingelez, MoMA has a lot to offer.

    The Thorvaldsens Museum presents the life's work of Bertel Thorvaldsens, a
    Danish sculptor who rose to fame in Rome around the turn of the 19th
    century. The museum thoughtfully curates his work by leading visitors
    through a passageway of small rooms, each of which contain a single large
    sculpture, and some supporting works. I highly recommend the free audio
    guide, which aids in the critical analysis and understanding of
    Thorvaldsen's work.

    aside from the stunning view, the Tate Modern has also impressed me with

    I've only had the opportunity to visit one or two floors.

    New York's newest major art museum is also one of my favorites. I first

    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/19/arts/artsspecial/new-whitney-museum.html">its
    interactive profile</a> on the building shortly before it opened. And when
    I first visited the museum, situated at the southern terminal of the High
    Line, I was impressed. Not with the art per se, as much as the building,
    the placement in the far West Village, and the experience of walking
    between its many balconies. Since then, I've enjoyed a few of the Whitney's
    exhibitions across of a few visits. It's not the place I'd spend an entire
    afternoon in, but it's definitely fun to visit, especially with first-timers
    or friends.

    though, is the collection of chairs, presented in a memorable albeit

    explored in any order you so choose. Storm King is home to many massive

    reason alone it's worth a visit. Especially on a day with good weather,
    Storm King is an outdoor afternoon worth experiencing.

    It's hard to weigh the experience of visiting the Acropolis Museum alone.
    When visiting Athens, there isn't a single tourist that doesn't make it to
    the Parthenon, the ancient ruin on a hill located in the center of the city.
    However, many don't talk about the museum at the foot of that hill
    dedicated to the history and art of the Parthenon and Acropolis.
    Contemporary architecture and ancient artifacts are a great combination, and
    a coffee on the balcony is a great way to top it off. The main attraction,
    however, is the Parthenon gallery on the third floor, where you can see a
    full recreation of the Parthenon's frieze (sculpted walls) that combines
    real artifacts with replicas.

    found the older work more compelling. The exception to that rule was the
    beautiful atrium space that connects the new and old buildings.

    personalized and engaging. Much of the Frick collection is made up of
    fantastic pieces that you can't find elsewhere, but there are also those
    that don't do much for me. I tend to camp out on the museum listserv and

  description: |
    While I love so much about the Cooper Hewitt, I sometimes feel like there's
    a bit of a generational divide when I visit. When I think of design, I think
    of the kinds of problem solving that has made its way into everything in our
    lives: architecture, technology, kitchen appliances, door handles, clothes,
    tools, and more. In many ways, it's the 99% Invisible definition of design.
    While Cooper Hewitt understands this definition on paper, I often get the
    sense that the curators still hold the 1960s / 1970s sense of the
    definition. I often find fantastic textile design pieces or interesting
    architectural models, but I rarely find the connection to my everyday life.
    I'm not asking for more touchscreens or video projectors (Cooper Hewitt has
    those), just a more modern approach. That said, for what it is, Cooper
    Hewitt really hits with some fantastic exhibitions that are hard to
    find elsewhere.

    The Tokyo National Museum is definitely impressive. It has an excellent

    pottery, and numerous artifacts fill two stories of this sizable building.
    I especially enjoy the architecture of the Gallery of Horyuji Treasures,
    which stands in front of an ultra-reflective pool. Repeat visits have been
    less exciting, as the collection does not change frequently, but it's
    absolutely worth a visit for first-timers in Tokyo.

    If you're in San Francisco, the SF MoMA is certainly worth visiting. In my

    and have been less inspired on return visits. The outdoor terraces are a
    welcome counterbalance to the gallery spaces, and the more memorable parts
    of the museum.
