    I quickly fell in love with MONA for its architecture. Built mostly
    underground into the side of a hill, the building is at once unremarkable
    from the outside and stunning on the inside. Even more impressive was the
    exhibition and curation. My favorite pieces were several by James Turell,
    an American MacArthur Genius Grant-winning artist that works mostly with
    light and space.

    I mean, it's the freaking Louvre. I have spent entire days wandering the
    halls of the Louvre and still left feeling like I had only seen a fraction
    of the museum. While there are many other reasons to travel to Paris, the
    Louvre alone is reason enough. I especially love the west wing, where five
    massive rooms are filled entirely with sculpture.

    The D. T. Suzuki museum is more experience than museum. While there is a
    small exhibition space that offers a historical look into this Japanese Zen
    philosopher, what pulls me back to Kanazawa to return here is the large
    outdoor contemplative space. Several times larger than the exhibition space
    indoors, this outdoor pool and walking area is intended for contemplation
    of Suzuki's writing and work.

    I've been to the Mori Art Museum twice, and was seriously impressed both
    times. The first was an exhibit on Japanese architecture, and the second
    was an exhibition called "The Soul Trembles" which very much lived up to
    its name. Located at the top of Mori Tower in Roppongi, the musueum has no
    permanent collection, just several gallery spaces. While I can't predict
    what will be on display in the future, I very much like the curators' taste.

    Visiting Tel Aviv, I did not expect to be as impressed with the Tel Aviv
    Museum of Art as I was. Not only does the museum feature a striking exterior
    and a mind-bending interior design, it also featured compelling contemporary
    and modern art. The collection, while smaller, was impressive to me and
    made for a fantastic visit.

    Just meters from the Louvre Museum, the Musée d'Orsay is a far less

    The only museum in my mind that can try to rival the Louvre is the Met.
    Having spent time living in the Upper East and Upper West Sides of New York
    City, getting to casually pop into the Met on an afternoon or evening is a
    privilege. Newcomers will flock to the Greek and Roman collection or to
    the preserved and recreated Egyptian tomb, but even after several visits
    I'm still finding new corners of the American Wing or enjoying temporary
    exhibitions.

    While the D. T. Suzuki Museum wins "best in Kanazawa, Japan" for me, I
    remain quite impressed with the collection of contemporary art in the 21st
    century museum. I still think about one exhibit that still has me theorizing
    how it was created. While that exhibit did not allow photography, this
    underwater pool exhibit did. See how they did it?

    New York City has no shortage of fantastic museums to explore within its

    of Dia:Beacon, an art museum on the banks of the Hudson River that houses a
    massive permanent collection of massive artworks, as well as a few special
    exhibitions. The museum occupies a Former Nabisco box-printing factory,
    which means awesome high ceilings, beautiful lighting, and even a creepy
    basement.

    While most New York tourists and locals alike have been to the Museum of

    to MoMA PS1, a branch of the museum situated in a former Long Island City
    elementary school. While I've thoroughly enjoyed the rotating set of
    exhibitions (the permanent collection is quite small), their summer Warm Up
    concert series is a big draw.

    Located near Tokyo Midtown in Roppongi, 21_21 Design Sight is a gallery
    space with rotating exhibitions. Built largely underground in a public park,
    the experience of descending into the gallery space is absolutely
    fantastic. Both times I visited, the exhibits (largely contemporary artists)
    impressed me with the creativity and attention to detail.

    The New York MoMA was the first modern art museum I visited as a conscious
    adult. While I firmly believe the MoMA is a must-visit for tourists and
    first-timers, I've been occasionally less lucky with some temporary
    exhibitions, but most of the time MoMA nails it. With exhibitions like
    their Charles White retrospective and the curious handcrafted cityscapes of
    Bodys Isek Kingelez, MoMA has a lot to offer.

    When I think of the Tate Modern, it's hard not to jump straight to the
    fantastic view of London that you can get from the observation deck. But
    aside from the stunning view, the Tate Modern has also impressed me with
    striking installations and exhibits. I'm looking forward to returning to
    London with enough time to give this museum a proper visit; in the past
    I've only had the opportunity to visit one or two floors.

    New York's newest major art museum is also one of my favorites. I first
    heard about the Whitney when the New York Times did
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/19/arts/artsspecial/new-whitney-museum.html">its
    interactive profile</a> on the building shortly before it opened. And when
    I first visited the museum, situated at the southern terminal of the High
    Line, I was impressed. Not with the art per se, as much as the building,
    the placement in the far West Village, and the experience of walking
    between its many balconies. Since then, I've enjoyed a few of the Whitney's
    exhibitions across of a few visits. It's not the place I'd spend an entire
    afternoon in, but it's definitely fun to visit, especially with first-timers
    or friends.

    This outdoor sculpture complex definitely stands out on this list as one of
    the stranger museums. Located just a twenty-minute drive away from
    Dia:Beacon, this outdoor space is designed to be walked, biked, and
    explored in any order you so choose. Storm King is home to many massive
    sculptures that wouldn't fit in any other museum or space, and for that
    reason alone it's worth a visit. Especially on a day with good weather,
    Storm King is an outdoor afternoon worth experiencing.

  description: |
    It's hard to weigh the experience of visiting the Acropolis Museum alone.
    When visiting Athens, there isn't a single tourist that doesn't make it to
    the Parthenon, the ancient ruin on a hill located in the center of the city.
    However, many don't talk about the museum at the foot of that hill
    dedicated to the history and art of the Parthenon and Acropolis.
    Contemporary architecture and ancient artifacts are a great combination, and
    a coffee on the balcony is a great way to top it off. The main attraction,
    however, is the Parthenon gallery on the third floor, where you can see a
    full recreation of the Parthenon's frieze (sculpted walls) that combines
    real artifacts with replicas.

    Located in downtown Sydney, the Art Gallery of New South Wales has a great

    If you visit the Vatican, you'll most likely end up spending time in the
    Vatican museum, a large collection of European, Asian, and African art
    collected (stolen?) by the church over the years. The collection is
    damn impressive, although the presentation is quite overwhelming. Visitors
    pack the hallways, making the museum feel more like one long line than
    something to be taken at your own pace.

    For me, the Frick is very hit or miss. I absolutely love the building and
    grounds, especially during member events when it's less crowded. I also
    really enjoy the curators and staff; every tour I've gone on has been very
    personalized and engaging. Much of the Frick collection is made up of
    fantastic pieces that you can't find elsewhere, but there are also those
    that don't do much for me. I tend to camp out on the museum listserv and
    watch out for interesting events or talks.

  description: |
    While I love so much about the Cooper Hewitt, I sometimes feel like there's
    a bit of a generational divide when I visit. When I think of design, I think
    of the kinds of problem solving that has made its way into everything in our
    lives: architecture, technology, kitchen appliances, door handles, clothes,
    tools, and more. In many ways, it's the 99% Invisible definition of design.
    While Cooper Hewitt understands this definition on paper, I often get the
    sense that the curators still hold the 1960s / 1970s sense of the
    definition. I often find fantastic textile design pieces or interesting
    architectural models, but I rarely find the connection to my everyday life.
    I'm not asking for more touchscreens or video projectors (Cooper Hewitt has
    those), just a more modern approach. That said, for what it is, Cooper
    Hewitt really hits with some fantastic exhibitions that are hard to
    find elsewhere.

    The Tokyo National Museum is definitely impressive. It has an excellent
    collection of Japanese historical pieces, from screen paintings to samurai
    armor and weapons. On my first visit, I hung onto every detail. Status,
    pottery, and numerous artifacts fill two stories of this sizable building.
    I especially enjoy the architecture of the Gallery of Horyuji Treasures,
    which stands in front of an ultra-reflective pool. Repeat visits have been
    less exciting, as the collection does not change frequently, but it's
    absolutely worth a visit for first-timers in Tokyo.

    My first impression of the Australian Museum was not entirely positive. It

    exhibition about prescription drug use, but overall did not leave impressed.
    I think a redo is in order.

    If you're in San Francisco, the SF MoMA is certainly worth visiting. In my
    opinion, it's the best art museum in the city. That said, no piece in the
    collection makes the museum unmissable. I enjoyed my first afternoon there,
    and have been less inspired on return visits. The outdoor terraces are a
    welcome counterbalance to the gallery spaces, and the more memorable parts
    of the museum.
