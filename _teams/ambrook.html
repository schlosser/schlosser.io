<p>In September 2020, I left The Times to start Ambrook with two long-time friends, <a href="https://twitter.com/ciaomack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackenzie</a> and <a href="https://jhil.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff</a>. At Ambrook, we build software that makes it easy for farmers to manage back-office finances. Our first products made it easy to find and apply to farm funding. We've helped farmers apply to Coronavirus Food Assistance Program funding, and created a comprehensive <a href="https://ambrook.ag/funding" target="_blank">farm funding library</a> with hundreds of grants, loans, and other funding programs.</p>
<p>Our current work is on a finance suite that saves producers time and money. These tools include cashflow tracking with per-crop accounting, bookkeeping features that save time and money on taxes, and cards that help automate expensing.</p>
