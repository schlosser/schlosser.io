<p>I spent two years as a product manager on the Google Drive team, in New York. I was the product owner for Drive's interoperability with Microsoft and the Drive consumer business. This included native desktop clients for Drive, Drive File Stream and Backup and Sync, the G Suite previewer, and Drive's integrations with Google Photos and Google Chrome.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-new-enterprise-ready-tools-google-drive/">Drive File Stream</a> is an enterprise-grade native desktop client for Windows and Mac. End users can access terrabytes of data without using hardly any hard drive space. Because Drive File Stream only syncs file and folder metadata and streams files on-demand, adminstrators can also enjoy reduced network load and fewer company files on-disk. <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/introducing-backup-and-sync-google-photos-and-google-drive/">Backup and Sync</a> is an app for Mac and PC that lets users save their pictures and files to Google Photos and Google Drive for easy access in the cloud or on any device. The G Suite previewer, used in apps like Gmail and Drive, lets users <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/new-ways-comment-microsoft-files-and-more-google-drive/">comment on Office files, PDFs, and more</a>.</p>
