<p>In the summer of 2013, I joined several other college students or recent graduates at the Campus Data Summit to discuss how we can open up University dataset for student developers.  I was joined by students from University of Waterloo, University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Duke University.  At this event, we wrote the original version of <a href="https://campusdata.github.io">campusdata.github.io</a>, a resource for student open data activists. We also wrote the <a href="https://campusdata.github.io/guidebook/">Campus Data Guidebook</a>, which collected stories and advice from our members.</p>

<p>Three years later, I built a new version of the <a href="https://campusdata.github.io/">Campus Data website</a>, which features a new page showing <a href="https://campusdata.github.iorankings/">rankings</a> of twenty schools and which data sets they have exposed to their students.</p>
